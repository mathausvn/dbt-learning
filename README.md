# 🧙‍♂️ My DBT Learning Lab

Welcome to my dbt projects, a sandbox repository where I’m getting my hands dirty learning all things **dbt (Data Build Tool)**!

## 🚀 What’s This About?

I'm currently enrolled in two courses to master dbt — from basics to advanced modeling techniques — and this repo will be my living notebook as I progress through them.

📚 **Courses I'm following**:

1. [DBT Course by DataGym](https://www.datagym.io/en)  
2. [Complete dbt Bootcamp on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-dbt-data-build-tool-bootcamp-zero-to-hero-learn-dbt/)

## 🧪 What You'll Find Here

- Hands-on exercises from both courses  
- Practice dbt models and projects  
- My notes, learnings, and maybe a few experiments that broke everything 😅  
- A few horrors along the way... it is Horrorland, after all 👻

## 🔧 Setup

This repo uses `dbt` with [Snowflake]. To get started:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mathausvn/dbt-learning.git
cd horrorland

# Install dependencies and build the project
dbt deps
dbt build
